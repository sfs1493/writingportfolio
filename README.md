I have written, co-authored, and managed diverse knowledge base websites or intranets across various positions for over ten years. My experience has diversified across process documentation, general resources, help center articles, complex services or integrations, styling guides, security, branding guidelines, education, and training.

I am currently Responsive Web Design Certified through Freecodecamp and am a self-paced student across web coding technology bootcamps. I enjoy learning to understand more about programming languages, best practices for clean code, and continuing to develop skills for educating or writing about code. A personal goal of mine is to continue participating in education and my career growth on understanding code to further progress my technical writing development and challenge myself to create content on increasingly complex coding or software concepts.
